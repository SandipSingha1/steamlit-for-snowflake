# Connect the Hierarchical Data Viewer to Snowflake

Can now either update a CSV file or query a Snowflake table or view, connecting to Snowflake with a Snowpark session. The child and parent columns are by default the first two columns, but can be changed. By default, the local *data/employees.csv* file is loaded transparently.
