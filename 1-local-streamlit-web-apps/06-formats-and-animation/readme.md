# Add Hierarchical Formats and Animation

Converts tabular hierarchical data into different semi-structured data formats: JSON, XML, YAML, including JSON with full path.

Renders hierarchical data with D3 animated charts. Some may use intermediary JSON data as input. Most charts here are based on a HTML template from the *animated/templates/* folder, and could save the generated HTML file in the *animated* folder.
